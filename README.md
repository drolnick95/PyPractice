Practice problem in python

### Element Frequency:
Given a sorted array of N elements with duplicates, for example:

a,b,b,b,b,b,d,h,h,h,p

count the number of occurrences of each unique element.

                1a) Solve this with an O(N) algorithm
                1b) Solve this with a better-than-O(N) algorithm

Test with a randomly generated array
